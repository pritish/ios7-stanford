Starts with the cardfront image (stanford's logo; solving for an initial flip miscount). User can click on the button to reveal a card from a single playing deck. A Flip counter displays the number of cards drawn until the deck is out of cards, then the image changes to an animated array of images (gameover1 + gameover2). The flip counter reflects flips of the card to the face, instead of all flips.
